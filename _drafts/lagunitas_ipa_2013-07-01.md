Recipe from [here][book]

target OG: 1.059-1.060
target FG: 1.014-1.015
target ABV: 5.7%

### Ingredients: 

##### Grains

+ 10.5 lb American 2-Row pale malt (originally called for 9.25, I upped by ~1 lb. as heard grinder at store not too good)
+ 12 oz. German Dark Munich malt
+ 8 oz. 10degree American crystal malt
+ 4 oz. 40degree American crystal malt

##### Hops
+ 1 oz Horizon
+ 0.5 oz Williamette 
+ ~2 oz Cascade 
+ 1 oz Centennial 

### Steps:

1. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured all malt in together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted 3 times, sparged with hotter water (165 deg F) twice (each time resting for about 10 min.), and added back to pot each time. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5.2 gallons. 
3. Add 
	+ 0.25 oz. Columbus hops 
	+ 0.25 oz. Simcoe hops
3. Bring to boil.
3. Add 
	+ 0.5 oz. Nuggett hops
4. Boil for 30 min.
5. Add 
	+ 0.25 oz. Columbus hops
6. Boil for 20 min.
7. At 15 left to go put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil (optional if you have one)
8. After 20 min, add
	+ 1 oz. Chinook hops
	+ 1 oz. Columbus hops
9. Boil for 5 minutes
10. Add
	+ 0.75 oz. Simcoe hops
11. Boil for 5 min.
12. Add 
	+ 1 oz. Simcoe hops
12. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
13. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
14. Put in yeast when temperature is right (Wyeast 1272 - American Ale II yeast, pitch yeast at 65 degrees F).
15. At start of secondary fermentation after primary (7 days later), add
	+ 1 oz. Chinook hops
	+ 1.5 oz. Columbus hops

Note: I lost about 1 gal during boil, but measured original gravity at right place before pitching yeast, so didn't want to add more water.
