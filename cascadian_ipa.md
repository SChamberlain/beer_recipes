# Petrus Tripel

The beer recipe was modeled after the "Hop in the Dark" and "Wooky Jack" beers.
 
My roommate Bryan found/made it, so if you have any questions you may want to direct them to him (he's cc'd here).
 
Malts:
1.75 lb Rye Malt
11.5 lb Pale
1 lb Midnight Wheat
0.5 lb Carastan
 
Our original gravity was 1.052.
 
For hops:
0.5 oz Magnum (1 hour boil)
4.75 oz Citra (1.5oz 30 min boil, 1.5oz 15 min boil, 1oz dry hop in the Primary, 0.75oz dry hop in the Secondary)
4.75 oz Amarillo (1.5oz 30 min boil, 1.5oz 15 min boil, 1oz dry hop in the Primary, 0.75oz dry hop in the Secondary)
 
Yeast:
WLP-002 White Labs English
 
As you can see, there's a silly amount of hops in the recipe.  And the specific amounts for each step are pretty approximate (all we wrote down was the total amount, the specific addition steps are made-up).
