## Ingredients

### Grains

+ 10 lb Mariss Otter

### Hop bill

+ 5 oz Amarillo

### Other

* yeast: Safale American US-05 (dry yeast)
* 1 tsp. Irish moss

### Boil

* 60 minutes

### Steps:

1. All grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted ~ 10 minutes, fly sparged with hotter water (170ish deg F), and added back to pot, ended up with about 6.5 gallons.
2. Add 0.5 oz hops
3. Bring to boil.
3. Add
	+ Add 0.5 oz. hops
4. Boil for 30 min.
5. Add 0.5 oz. hops
6. Boil for 15 min.
5. Add 0.5 oz. hops
5. Boil 5 min.
8. Add 1 tsp. Irish Moss
9. Boil 10 minutes
10. Add 1 oz. hops
12. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
13. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
	* measure gravity (OG)
14. Pitched yeast at ~70 degrees F
15. At start of secondary fermentation (kept in same carbouy) on 2016-07-24, add 2 oz. hops
16. Just before bottling, used 4 oz. light DME dissolved in 1.5 c. water
