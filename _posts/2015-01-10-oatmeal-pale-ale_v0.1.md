This is v0.1 of this clone. I'm modifying this slightly from the original recipe. The target was to get a clone of Burnside Brewing's Oatmeal Pale Ale...we'll see how it goes. 

### Ingredients:

* 9.5 lb Pilsner grain ?? (original recipe used 7 lbs Pilsner LME) (GET)
* 3 lb Crystal 15L (GET)
* 1 lb Flaked Oats or Rolled Oats (GET)
* 1 tsp Irish Moss
* 2 oz Centennial (GET more, like 5 oz)
* 2 oz Saaz (original recipe used Cascade)
* 2 oz Mt. Hood (GET more, like 5 oz)
* Wyeast 1056 American Ale (GET)

### Steps:

1. Did all grain in a [mash tun][mashtun]. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 165 degrees F. Steeped Crystal and oats in ~ 4 gallons of water. Stirred occasionally, measured temperature; if too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add 
    + 1 oz. Nugget hops (for bittering)
    + 1 oz. Saaz hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
    + 1/3 oz. Perle hops (for flavor)
    + 1/3 oz. German Hallertau hops (for flavor)
    + 1 tbsp irish moss
    + (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
    + 1/3 oz. Cascade hops
    + 1/3 oz. Nugget hops
8. Boil for 1 minute 
    + Measure initial gravity at this point, should be 1.055 (if not matching, perhaps put in more sugar if number too low, or more water if number too high)
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (carboy)
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (yeast, pitched yeast at 68-72 degrees F)
12. On 2015-01-xx moved to secondary fermenter (bucket)
13. Bottled on 2015-01-xx
