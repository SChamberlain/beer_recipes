### Stock IPA recipe kit from F.H. Steinbart in Potland, OR

This was a kit recipe from the homebrew store [F.H. Steinbart](http://www.fhsteinbart.com/) in Portland, OR, where I bought my beer brewing tools last August (everything's cheaper in the states). 

I made this I think near the end of January, drinking now (todays date: 2013-03-18). Its not super hoppy, but has a good flavor. Everyone seems to like it, so....

This is what the beer looks like after X days. Quite drinkable me thinks. In a Rogue glass for style points.
