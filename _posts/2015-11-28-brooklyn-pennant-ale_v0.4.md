This is a clone of Brooklyn Pennant Ale pale ale from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book].

This is `v0.4` of this clone. Made `v0.1` on [2013-06-13](/beer_recipes/2013/06/13/brooklyn-pennant-ale-v0-1/), `v0.2` on [2014-01-05](/beer_recipes/2014/01/05/brooklyn-pennant-ale-v0-2/), and `v0.3` on [2015-01-05](/beer_recipes/2015/01/04/brooklyn-pennant-ale-v0-3/). In `v0.4` I'm going back to hops the original clone recipe called for: Fuggles and Willamette, Perle, German Hallertau, Cascade. And using a different yeast (see below).

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 11 lbs British 2 row pale malt
+ 9 oz British crystal malt
+ 6 oz aromatic malt

##### Hop bill

+ 1 1/3 oz. Fuggles
+ 1 oz. Willamette
+ 1/3 oz. Perle
+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau
+ 1/3 oz. Cascade

##### Yeast

+ [Imperial Yeast `A09 Pub`](http://www.imperialyeast.com/yeast-strains/) (recipe had Wyeast 1968 London ESB)

##### Other ingredients

+ 1 tsp. Irish moss
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 154 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot.
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add
	+ 1 oz. Fuggles hops (for bittering)
	+ 1 oz. Willamette hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle hops (for flavor)
	+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau hops (for flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Cascade hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Fuggles hops
8. Boil for 1 minute
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Measure initial gravity at this point
11. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (bucket)
12. Pitched yeast at 69 degrees F
13. On 2015-12-02 moved to secondary fermenter (carboy)
14. Bottled on 2015-12-05
