This is a clone of Chicken Killer Barley Wine ale from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book].

This is `v0.1` of this clone.

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 15.25 lbs American 2-row pale malt
+ 9 oz 120L American crystal malt
+ 4 oz 40L American crystal malt
+ 4 oz Belgian Cara-Munich malt
+ 4 oz melanoidin malt
+ 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar

##### Hop bill

+ 2.1 oz. Chinook
+ 1.25 oz. Hallertau
+ 1.5 oz. Crystal
+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau
+ 1/3 oz. Cascade

##### Yeast

+ [Imperial Yeast xxx](http://www.imperialyeast.com/yeast-strains/) (recipe had Danstar Windsor ale yeast or Wyeast WLP099 super high gravity ale yeast)

##### Other ingredients

+ 1 tsp. Irish moss
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME
+ salts?

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 154 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot.
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add
	+ 1 oz. Fuggles hops (for bittering)
	+ 1 oz. Willamette hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle hops (for flavor)
	+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau hops (for flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Cascade hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Fuggles hops
8. Boil for 1 minute
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Measure initial gravity at this point
11. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (bucket)
12. Pitched yeast at 69 degrees F
13. On xxxx moved to secondary fermenter (carboy)
14. Bottled on xxxx
