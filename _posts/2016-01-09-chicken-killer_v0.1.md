This is a clone of [Chicken Killer Barley Wine ale](http://www.santafebrewing.com/our_beer/detail/23) from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book].

This is `v0.1` of this clone.

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 16.5 lbs American 2-row pale malt (called for 15.25 lbs)
+ 9 oz British dark crystal malt - suggested by brewshop folks (called for 120L American crystal malt)
+ 4 oz 40L American crystal malt
+ 4 oz Belgian Cara-Munich malt
+ 4 oz melanoidin malt

##### Hop bill

+ 2.1 oz. Chinook
+ 1.25 oz. US Hallertau (called for German H.)
+ 1.25 oz. Crystal

##### Yeast

+ [Imperial Yeast xxx](http://www.imperialyeast.com/yeast-strains/) (recipe had Danstar Windsor ale yeast or Wyeast WLP099 super high gravity ale yeast)

##### Other ingredients

+ 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar
+ 1 tsp. Irish moss
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME
+ salts?

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot.
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add
	+ 2.1 oz. Chinook hops (bittering)
    + 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1 oz. US Hallertau (flavor)
	+ 1/4 oz. Crystal (flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1 oz. Crystal (aroma)
8. Boil for 1 minute
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Measure initial gravity at this point
11. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (bucket)
12. Pitched yeast at ~67 degrees F
13. On xxxx moved to secondary fermenter (carboy)
14. Bottled on xxxx
