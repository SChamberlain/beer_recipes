From [here](http://forum.northernbrewer.com/t/cascadian-dark-ale-recipe-questions/12320/18). Original recipe called it a Cascadian Dark Ale.

This is version 2, for 1st version, see the [2013-06-16 post](http://recology.info/beer_recipes//recipe/2013/06/16/cascadian-ipa.html).

## Ingredients

### Grains

+ 10.6 lb American 2-Row (original called for 10, I upped by 0.6 lb.)
+ 2 lb Munich I
+ 1 lb Carafa III malt
+ 0.5 lb Crystal 120
+ 0.25 lb Crystal 60

### Hop bill

+ 3 oz Columbus (US Saaz instead?) (already got)
+ 2.5 oz Nugget (already got) (2 oz Chinook -> Nugget)
+ 1.25 oz Perle (instead of Simcoe)
+ 0.75 oz Fuggles (instead of Simcoe)

### Other

* yeast: Imperial A01 House
* 1 tsp. Irish moss

### Boil

* 75 minutes

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted ~ 10 minutes, fly sparged with hotter water (170ish deg F), and added back to pot, ended up with about 6.5 gallons.
3. Add
	+ 0.25 oz. US Saaz hops
	+ 0.25 oz. Perle hops
3. Bring to boil.
3. Add
	+ 0.5 oz. Nuggett hops
	+ 2 tsp. burton water salts
4. Boil for 45 min.
5. Add
	+ 0.25 oz. US Saaz hops
6. Boil for 20 min.
8. After 20 min (at 10 min. remaining), add
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ 1 oz. Nugget hops
	+ 1 oz. US Saaz hops
	+ put in copper tubing apparatus to sterilize
9. Boil for 5 minutes
10. Add
	+ 0.75 oz. Fuggles hops
11. Boil for 5 min.
12. Add
	+ 1 oz. Perle hops
12. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
13. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
	* measure gravity (OG)
14. Pitched yeast at ~64 degrees F
15. At start of secondary fermentation after primary (7 days later), add
	+ 1 oz. Nugget hops
	+ 1.5 oz. US Saaz hops
16. Just before bottling, used 1.5 c. light DME
