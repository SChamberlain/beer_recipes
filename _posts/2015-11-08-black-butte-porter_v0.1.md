This is a clone of Black Butte porter from the [American Homebrewer's Association][here].

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 9.0 lb (4.08 kg) Northwestern two-row pale malt
+ 12.8 oz (363 g) chocolate wheat malt
+ 8.0 oz (227 g) 80Â° L crystal malt
+ 5.0 oz (142 g) dextrin malt
<!-- + 10 lbs American 2-Row pale malt (original called for 9.25, I upped a bitto account for probably lower efficiency of extraction process I have)
+ 12 oz. German Dark Munich malt 
+ 8 oz. 10oL American crystal malt
+ 4 oz. 40oL American crystal malt -->

##### Hop bill

+ 0.5 oz (14 g) Galena pellet hops, 13% a.a. (90 min)
+ 0.25 oz (7 g) Cascade pellet hops, 5.75% a.a. (15 min)
+ 0.25 oz (7 g) Hallertauer pellet hops, 4.5% a.a. (5 min)
<!-- + 1 oz Magnum (recipe had Horizon) (recipe said to do 29% less than 1 oz for all grain, but I like the hops)
+ 0.5 oz Willamette
+ 1.4 oz Cascade
+ 0.6 oz Centennial -->

##### Yeast

+ English ale yeast (White Labs WLP 002 or Wyeast 1968 London ESB)

### Steps:

1. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 153 degrees F. Then poured all malt in together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted 3 times, sparged with hotter water (168 deg F) twice (each time resting for about 10 min.), and added back to pot each time. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5.5 gallons.
3. Add 
    + 2 tsp. burton water salts
    + 1 oz. Galena hops (recipe had 0.5 oz)
4. Boil for 75 min.
5. Add 
    + 0.3 oz. Cascade hops (recipe had 0.25)
    + 1 tsp. Irish moss
6. Boil for 10 min.
8. Add
    + 0.25 oz. Hallertauer hops
9. Boil for 5 minutes
10. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
11. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
12. Put in yeast when temperature is right (~ 69 degrees F).
13. Just before bottling, boiled 1.25 c. DME, added to mix, and then bottled. 

> Note: At 15 left to go put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil (optional if you have one)
